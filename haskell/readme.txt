2- Write a function that combnes two lists by alternatingly taking elements
	f [1,2,3] [4,5,6] = [1,4,3,5,3,6]

3- Write a function that computes a list of the first 100 fibonacci numbers

4- Write a function that given a list of non-negative intergers, arranges them such that they form the largest number possible
   f [9,8,70] = 9870

5- Write a function that returns all possibilities to put +, -, or '' between the elements of [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] such that the result evalultes to 100 exactly
